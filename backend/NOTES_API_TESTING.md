# Study Notes API Testing Guide

## 🎯 Complete Testing Workflow

Your personalized study notes system is now ready! Here's how to test it:

## 📋 **Prerequisites**

- ✅ Server running: `python main.py`
- ✅ Ollama running: `ollama serve`
- ✅ Pinecone configured (or test mode enabled)
- ✅ Test token: `Bearer test_token`

## 🚀 **Testing Sequence**

### **Step 1: Upload PDF and Generate Quiz**

```bash
# 1. Upload PDF
POST /pdf/upload
# (Use form-data with a PDF file)

# 2. Wait for processing
GET /pdf/{pdf_id}
# (Wait until status = "completed")

# 3. Generate quiz
POST /quiz/generate/{pdf_id}
{
  "num_questions": 5,
  "difficulty_range": [1, 3]
}

# 4. Take quiz (get some wrong for better notes)
POST /quiz/{quiz_id}/submit
{
  "answers": {
    "question_1_id": "wrong_answer",
    "question_2_id": "correct_answer",
    "question_3_id": "wrong_answer"
  }
}
# Save the quiz_attempt_id from response
```

### **Step 2: Generate Personalized Study Notes**

```bash
# Generate comprehensive study notes
POST /notes/generate/{quiz_attempt_id}
{
  "quiz_attempt_id": "attempt_123",
  "include_examples": true,
  "study_level": "comprehensive"
}
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "notes": {
    "id": "notes_pdf_123_1234567890",
    "pdf_title": "Introduction to Machine Learning.pdf",
    "performance_summary": {
      "score": 60.0,
      "level": "needs_improvement",
      "weak_topics": ["neural_networks", "deep_learning", "algorithms"],
      "total_questions": 5,
      "correct_answers": 3
    },
    "study_notes": "# Study Notes for Introduction to Machine Learning\n\n## Performance Summary\n- Quiz Score: 60.0%\n- Areas needing improvement: neural networks, deep learning...",
    "topics_covered": [
      "neural_networks",
      "deep_learning",
      "supervised_learning"
    ],
    "study_priority": "high",
    "estimated_study_time": "2-3 hours comprehensive review",
    "next_review_date": "2024-01-15"
  },
  "generation_stats": {
    "topics_analyzed": 3,
    "content_sources_used": 8,
    "performance_score": 60.0,
    "weak_areas_identified": 2
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Focus on neural network fundamentals",
    "Practice with deep learning examples",
    "Review mathematical concepts behind algorithms"
  ]
}
```

### **Step 3: Access and Manage Notes**

```bash
# Get specific notes
GET /notes/{notes_id}

# Get all notes for a PDF
GET /notes/pdf/{pdf_id}

# Get all user notes
GET /notes/user/all

# Get performance analytics
GET /notes/analytics/performance
```
